## Model Evaluation

### Best K Value:
The best K value determined through cross-validation is {best_k}.

### Accuracy Visualization:
The plot above shows the accuracy for different K values. The highest accuracy is achieved when K is {best_k}.

### 5-Fold Cross-Validation:
The mean accuracy across 5 folds is {mean_cv_score}, with a standard deviation of {std_cv_score}.

### Confusion Matrix:
The confusion matrix for the test set is as follows:

```

        The best K value determined through cross-validation is {best_k}.

```python

### Overall Accuracy:
The overall accuracy on the test set is {accuracy}.
